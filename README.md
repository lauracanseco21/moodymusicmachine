# moodymusicmachine
Our project generates a Spotify playlist based on the user’s mood. We run natural language sentiment analysis (using NLTK) on the user’s given mood and convert the input to beats per minute. The program then finds songs within a range of that BPM. Finally, it generates a playlist of twenty songs directly in the Spotify account (using Selenium).
